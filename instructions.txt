Hello Everyone! Kevin here to say thank you for joining us on this project, here are some the questions Justo asked that we should all reflect on when creating the website:
Here are the main questions we need answered before we can commit to any website per se. The answers to these questions will inform how we design the website, as well as it's content.
 1.What are your personal goals within your initiative / cause  (e.g. I want to help fundraise)
 2.What are the goals of your initiative / cause? (Make sure to be specific. e.g. We want to make sure the victim's family has enough money to pay for their hospital bills, etc.")
 3.What actions or things have you and your group done to accomplish those goals?
 4.How do you best see a website helping out with those goals?
I hope everyone has a great time doing this.
